Few things to note, if you own a router and wish to play with people outside your LAN you may have to portforward port 7777 to you internal ipv4 adress. You may find your internal ipv4 by typing "ipconfig" in command prompt. And you may only host in a build version however you can still connect as a client in editor. Trying to find a way around this, still learning :)

Made in Unity.
